Welcome to the MooTools Test/Demo Runner
----------

This environment allows developers to write interactive tests and demos. To install, see the [README on github](http://github.com/anutron/mootools-test-runner#readme).

Browsing the Tests / Demos
----------

The test environment should find all available tests and list them in a menu on the left of the screen. Clicking any test should load it with all the required JavaScript. Once loaded, the interactive test should be available for you to manipulate. Some tests are somewhat passive - you just watch them do something - but most allow you to click things. Each test should have instructions on what to do.
